I unfortunately did not have any of my source files set up in a repository so there are no commits to see. 
On the admin side of things, to modify the questions you'll need to double click on the question you wish to modify. This will populate the fields with the question information. You make the changes in the text boxes and click "save changes". That will modify the question. To get the questions to appear, select the group of questions you wish to see from the course dropdown box. It's at the top of the screen.
Q3AssesmentFINAL.py and quiz_bowl.db are the only two files that really matter. They're the ones that work. I attached a few other files so you can see the early stages and the progess that I made.
