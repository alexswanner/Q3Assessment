# Q3Assessment
This was miserable. I just finished at 4 in the morning. I've been working on it since 10pm. 
I unfortunately did not have any of my source files set up in a repository so there are no commits to see. 
On the admin side of things, to modify the questions you'll need to double click on the question you wish to modify. This will populate the fields with the question information. You make the changes in the text boxes and click "save changes". That will modify the question.
